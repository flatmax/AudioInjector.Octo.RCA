These KiCad (http://kicad-pcb.org/) files give both the schematic and PCB
gerber layouts for the RCA breakouts for the Audio Injector Octo sound

These single ended breakout boards are derived from the manufacturer's data sheet specifications for single ended breakouts of the codec used in the Octo sound card.
